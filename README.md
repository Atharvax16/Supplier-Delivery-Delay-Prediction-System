# Supplier-Delivery-Delay-Prediction-System
The project aims to build a two-step machine learning pipeline for predicting supplier delivery delays using historical supply chain data. First, after extracting appropriate target variables and performing necessary preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), a classification model is trained to predict whether there is a delay or not
